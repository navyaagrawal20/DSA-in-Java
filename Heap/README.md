# 🧮 Heap Data Structure in Java

This repository contains an implementation of a **Generic Binary Max-Heap** in Java using `ArrayList`.  
It supports insertion, deletion (removal of root), and heap sort operations with efficient time complexity.

---

## 📘 What is a Heap?

A **Heap** is a special **complete binary tree** data structure that maintains a specific ordering property:

### ✅ Max-Heap Property
For every node `i`:

```

parent(i) ≥ child(i)

```

Meaning the **largest** value is always at the root.

### ❗ Min-Heap (Opposite)
```

parent(i) ≤ child(i)

```

Heaps are typically stored as arrays for efficiency, representing a complete binary tree structure.

## ⚙️ Features

- Generic type support `<T extends Comparable<T>>`
- Max-Heap implementation
- Insert operation (Up-Heap / Bubble-Up / Percolate Up)
- Remove root (Down-Heap / Heapify)
- Heap Sort implementation using heap operations
- Java Collections (`ArrayList`) used as underlying storage

## 🧠 Time Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Insertion** | `O(log n)` | Percolates up the heap |
| **Remove (Root)** | `O(log n)` | Percolates down to maintain heap |
| **Peek (Get Max)** | `O(1)` | Direct root access |
| **Heapify (Build Heap)** | `O(n)` | Optimal bottom-up heap build |
| **Heap Sort** | `O(n log n)` | Repeated removal from heap |
| **Search** | `O(n)` | Not indexed search structure |

## 🧠 Where Heaps Are Used

| Domain | Use Case |
|--------|---------|
| Operating Systems | CPU Job Scheduling (Priority Queue) |
| Networking | Packet Scheduling / Bandwidth Allocation |
| Graph Algorithms | Dijkstra’s & Prim’s algorithms |
| Machine Learning | Top-K elements, priority processing |
| Blockchain | Transaction fee priority |
| Real-Time Systems | Task scheduling (queues & concurrency) |
| E-Commerce & Search | Ranking, Recommendation systems |
| Streaming Data | Running median, frequency counting |

## 🧩 Components in Code

| Component | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `ArrayList<T>` | Stores heap elements |
| `insert()` | Inserts and adjusts heap ↑ |
| `remove()` | Removes root and heapifies ↓ |
| `swap()` | Utility to swap elements |
| `heapSort()` | Returns sorted list using heap logic |
| `Comparable<T>` | Ensures objects can be compared |

## 📂 Example Output

```

This is Heap Data Structure
Heap after insertions: [8, 4, 7, 3, 1, 5, 6, 2]
Sorted elements: [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
